- The Gravity sensor is what android called a 'software sensor' and calculates its values using more than one hardware sensor.
- The software Gravity sensor is only available if the device has a gryroscope.
- The gravity sensor provides a three diamensional vector indicating the direction and magnetic of gravity.
- Typically,this sensor is used to determine the device's relative orientation in space
- In civil engineering, gravity sensors can be used to detect anything under the ground that creates a mass difference.
- They could help find buried infrastructure such as pipes,tunnels and old mine shafts

- A gravity sensor, also known as an accelerometer, is a sensor that measures acceleration, tilt, and vibration in a particular direction. Arduino is an open-source electronics platform that is widely used for creating interactive projects.

- To use a gravity sensor with Arduino, you need to connect the sensor to the Arduino board and then write a program to read the sensor data. Here are the basic steps:

  1.Connect the gravity sensor to the Arduino board: Depending on the type of sensor you have, you may need to connect it to the board using pins or a shield.

  2.Write a program to read the sensor data: You can use the Arduino IDE to write a program that reads the sensor data and prints it to the serial monitor.

  3.Interpret the sensor data: Once you have the sensor data, you can use it to control other parts of your project. For example, you could use the data to control the movement of a robot or the position of a servo motor.

## Features

- Measurement range: Gravity sensors have a measurement range, which specifies the minimum and maximum acceleration values that the sensor can detect. For example, a typical gravity sensor might have a range of +/-2g or +/-16g, meaning it can measure accelerations between -2g and +2g or between -16g and +16g.

- Sensitivity: Gravity sensors have a sensitivity, which specifies the smallest change in acceleration that the sensor can detect. This is usually expressed in units of g per LSB (least significant bit).

- Resolution: The resolution of a gravity sensor is the smallest difference between two acceleration values that the sensor can distinguish. This is determined by the number of bits used to represent the acceleration value.

- Sampling rate: The sampling rate of a gravity sensor is the frequency at which the sensor takes measurements. This is usually expressed in hertz (Hz), and determines how quickly the sensor can respond to changes in acceleration.

- Communication protocol: Gravity sensors typically communicate with a microcontroller or other device using a digital communication protocol such as I2C or SPI.

- Power consumption: The power consumption of a gravity sensor is an important consideration for battery-powered applications. Some sensors have a low-power mode that reduces the power consumption when the sensor is not in use.

- Noise level: Gravity sensors are subject to noise from various sources, including temperature variations and electromagnetic interference. The noise level of a sensor affects its accuracy and can be reduced through filtering or other signal processing techniques. 

## Draw backs

- Limited range: Gravity sensors have a limited range of acceleration values that they can measure, which may not be sufficient for applications that require high acceleration measurements, such as aerospace or automotive applications.

- Limited sensitivity: Gravity sensors have a limited sensitivity, which means they may not be able to detect small changes in acceleration. This may be a problem in applications where high precision is required.

- Limited accuracy: Gravity sensors are subject to various sources of error, including noise and drift, which can affect their accuracy. This may be a problem in applications where high accuracy is required.

- Cross-axis sensitivity: Gravity sensors may be sensitive to acceleration in directions other than the intended axis, which can lead to measurement errors. This can be mitigated through careful sensor placement and calibration.

- Temperature sensitivity: Gravity sensors may be sensitive to temperature variations, which can affect their accuracy. This can be mitigated through temperature compensation or other calibration techniques.

- Power consumption: Gravity sensors require power to operate, which can be a problem in battery-powered applications. Some sensors have a low-power mode that reduces power consumption when the sensor is not in use.

- Size and cost: Gravity sensors can be relatively large and expensive, which may limit their use in applications where size and cost are critical factors.
