# C0044-Laser Module

A laser module is a device that emits a focused beam of coherent light. It is commonly used as a laser pointer, and is compatible with microcontrollers such as Arduino, Raspberry PI, and ESP32. The laser module consists of a laser diode and a lens or other optical element that focuses the beam.

## How to Connect to a Circuit

Connect the signal pin (S) of the laser module to pin 13 on the Arduino and the ground (-) to GND. The middle pin on the module is not used. Here is the connection diagram.

## The Theory behind the Components

The laser diode is an electronic component that produces laser light through the process of stimulated emission. The emitted light is coherent and focused by a lens or other optical element. The laser module emits a dot-shaped, red laser beam.
