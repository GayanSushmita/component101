# Laser Module

- A laser module is an electronic component that emits a focused beam of coherent light.
- It typically consists of a laser diode, which is an electronic component that produces laser light,and a lens or other optical element that focuses the beam.
- The Laser Transmitter module can be used as a laser pointer.It emits a dot shaped,red laser beam.
- Compatible with Arduino,Raspberry PI,ESP32 and other popular microcontrollers.
