# C0003-Temperature sensor

## Introduction to temperature sensors
Temperature sensors are devices used to measure the temperature of an object or an environment. They are widely used in various applications, including weather forecasting, industrial processes, HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems, medical devices, and consumer electronics. Temperature sensors provide valuable data for controlling and monitoring processes, ensuring safety, and optimizing efficiency.

There are several types of temperature sensors, each with its own working principle:
## Thermocouples:
Thermocouples are made by connecting two different metal wires at one end. When there is a temperature difference between the two ends, it creates a voltage that can be used to measure the temperature.

## Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTDs):
RTDs are temperature sensors made of pure platinum, which changes resistance with temperature. The resistance increase is proportional to the temperature change, allowing precise temperature measurements.

## Thermistors:
Thermistors are temperature-sensitive resistors whose resistance changes significantly with temperature. They can be classified into two types: NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) thermistors, where resistance decreases with temperature, and PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) thermistors, where resistance increases with temperature.

## Infrared Temperature Sensors:
These sensors measure the infrared radiation emitted by an object and calculate its temperature based on the emitted radiation. They are commonly used for non-contact temperature measurements.

## Bimetallic Temperature Sensors:
Bimetallic strips consist of two different metals bonded together. When heated or cooled, the metals expand or contract at different rates, causing the strip to bend. This bending can be used to measure temperature changes.

## Digital Temperature Sensors:
These sensors use digital interfaces like I2C or SPI to communicate temperature readings. They often integrate an analog sensor with an analog-to-digital converter and signal processing circuitry.

Temperature sensors play a crucial role in various industries, enabling precise temperature control and ensuring the safe operation of equipment and processes.

## How to connect to a circuit

- Pin 1 of the temperature sensor is connected to DC 5V.
- Pin 2 is connected to any analog signal pin on the Arduino board.
- Pin 3 is connected to the GND pin on the board.

## The theory behind the components

The temperature sensor converts the surrounding temperature to voltage using a thermistor, which is a type of resistor that changes its resistance with temperature. As the temperature increases, the resistance of the thermistor decreases, which causes an increase in the voltage output of the sensor. This voltage output is then converted to Fahrenheit using a formula and displayed on an LCD.
