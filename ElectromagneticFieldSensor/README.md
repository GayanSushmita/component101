# Electromagnetic Field Sensor 
- EMF is an abbreviation for the electromagnetic field.So, an Electromagnetic field detector can detect the electromagnetic field in a Specific region.
- In other words,you can say that an EMF detector can perform EMF measurements.
- An EMF detector detects radiation by examining the non-ionizing radiation emitted by electromagnetic device and household appliences.
- When an EMF detector detects any radiation,it will show a reading that describes the radiation's strength or weakness
