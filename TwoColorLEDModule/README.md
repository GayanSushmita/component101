# C0016-Two Color LED Module

The two color LED module is a light emitting diode that can emit two different colors of light, typically red and green. It is commonly used in electronic projects that require status indicators or display functions. In this module, the two LEDs are connected back to back, and their anodes are connected to separate pins. By controlling the voltage and duty cycle of each pin using PWM, you can create various colors and shades.

## How to Connect to a Circuit

The two color LED module has three pins: GND, RED, and GREEN. The GND pin should be connected to the ground of the circuit. The RED and GREEN pins should be connected to two separate digital output pins of the microcontroller or Arduino board. Here is a wiring diagram for connecting the two color LED module to an Arduino Uno:

## The Theory Behind the Components

The two color LED module is a type of light emitting diode, which is a semiconductor device that emits light when a voltage is applied. In this module, two LEDs of different colors are connected back to back, and their anodes are connected to separate pins. When a positive voltage is applied to the anode of one LED, it emits light of one color (e.g., green), and when the voltage is applied to the anode of the other LED, it emits light of the other color (e.g., red). By varying the voltage and duty cycle of each pin using PWM, you can control the intensity of each color and create various colors and shades.
