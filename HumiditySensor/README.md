# Humidity Sensor

- The humadity sensor is a device that senses, measures and reports the relative humadity (RH) Of air or determines the amount of water vapor present in gas mixture (air) or pure gas.
- Humadity sensors work by detecting changes that alter electrical current or temperature in the air.
- There are basic type of humaditu sensors.
- Capacitive,Resitive and thermal.
- All three type will monitor minute changes in the atmosphere in order to calculate the humidity in the air.
- The VCC pin is connected to the 5V and GND pin is connected to the GND
- The signal pin is goes to A0 port
