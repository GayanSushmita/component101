# Vibration sensor
- A vibration sensor,also known as a piezoelectric sensor,has many types that are used to measure the accelaration, pressure, vibration changes of a device or system.
- It can be used alongside an arduino or Raspberry Pi through the miniaturized or MEMS vibration sensor modules that are common nowadays.

- Connect one pin of vibration sensor to Arduino Analog pin A0 and the other to 5V Pin.
- Now connect the buzzet,one pin to Arduino pin 8  and the other to GND. 
### How does vibration sensor works.?
- They have a transducer that converts mechanical force caused by vibration or a change in mortion, into an elctricao current using the piezoelectric effect.
- High impedance accelerometers produce an elctrical charge which is connected directly to the measurement instruments.
- There are three main types of accelerometers
 1.Piezoelectric
 2.Piezoresistive
 3. Capasitive MEMS
