# Mortion sensor
- designed to detect and measure movement.
- It used primarily in home and bussiness secuirty system, but they can also be found in phones,papers towel dispensers,game consoles,and virtual reality systems.
- unlike many other type of sensors,(which can be handheld and isolated),motion sensors are typically embedded systems with three major components.
   1. a sensor.
   2. an embedded computer
   3. hardware
- There three parts vary in size and configuration,as motion sensors can be customized to perform highly specific funtions.for example,
  - mortion sensor can be used to activate floodlight,trigger audible alarms,activate switches and event arlets the police. 
- there are two type of mortion sensors.
   1. active mortion 
   2. passive mortion
### Active Mortion sensor.
- Acitive sensors have both a transmitter and receiver.
- This type of sensor detects mortion by measuring changers,in amount of sound and radiation reflecting back into the receiver.
- when an object interrupts the or alter the sensor field,and electric is send to the embidedded computer,whitch an turn with interacts with the mechanical component.
- The most common type of active mortion detector uses <b>Ultrasonic Sensor</b> technology.
  - Ultrasonic sensors emit the sound waves to detect the presence of objects.there are also microwave sonsors(whitch emit microwave radiation.),and termographic sensors (which transmit and receive radiation waves).

### Passive Mortion sensor

- Passive mortion sensor doesn't have a transmitter.
- Insead of measuring a constant reflection,the sensor based the mortion based on a precieved increase of radiation in its environment.
- The most widly used type of passive mortion sensor in home security system is the passive infrared (PIR)sensor.
- The PRI sensor is designed to detect the infrared radiation emmited naturally from the human body.
- The receiver is contain in a filter that only allows infrared to pass it.
 - when a person walks into the PRI sensor's feild of detection,the difference ratiation creats a positive charge with a receiver.,this perceived change causes the sensing unit to send electrical data to embidded computer and hardware component.
