# C0048-QR Reader

A QR code (Quick Response code) is a two-dimensional barcode that is capable of storing more data than traditional barcodes. A barcode scanner is used to read and decode the data stored in the barcode. The Maikrt Embedded QR code barcode scanning module is a small 1D/2D codes reader that can be embedded in any device for scanning code to identify other items.

## How to Connect to a Circuit

The Maikrt Embedded QR code barcode scanning module can be interfaced with a microcontroller or a computer through its USB and TTL interfaces. The module has a 9 pin 4 wire terminal line that can be connected to a microcontroller. The red wire is the VCC (+5V) pin, black is the GND. The green and white wires are the TX and RX pins.

## Theory Behind the Components

- The Maikrt Embedded QR code barcode scanning module consists of a lens, a source of light, and a light sensor that can translate optical impulses into electrical signals. 
- The module uses an intelligent image recognition algorithm for reading QR or Barcode data. It can easily capture barcodes 1D,2D on labels, paper and mobile phone or computer displays.
- The module has both USB and TTL interfaces for direct interfacing with a computer or a microcontroller.
