# C0038-MOSFET Module

## Introduction

- The IRF520 MOSFET Driver Module is a PWM-based module that is used to control the speed of DC motors. It is a versatile and easy-to-use module that converts a constant input voltage to a variable voltage. By changing the voltage across the DC motor, the motor's speed can be controlled.

## How to Connect to a Circuit

The IRF520 MOSFET Driver Module can be connected to a circuit in the following way:

- Connect the VCC pin to a 5V power supply.
- Connect the GND pin to ground.
- Connect the SIG pin to the PWM input signal.
- Connect the Vin pin to the input voltage (between 5-24V).
- Connect the Out pin to the motor.

## The Theory Behind the Components

- The main component of the IRF520 MOSFET Driver Module is the IRF520 MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor). The MOSFET is a type of transistor that is commonly used to switch electronic signals. It works by controlling the flow of electrons through a channel that is formed by a voltage applied to a metal gate.

- In this module, the MOSFET is used as a switch to control the voltage applied to the DC motor. By using PWM, the module can control the duty cycle of the signal, which in turn controls the voltage applied to the motor.
