# Pressure Sensor

- A Pressure sensor(sometimes pressure transducer or transmitter) measures the physical quantity pressure and converts it into a standardized electric measurement signal.
- At analog Microelectrics we develop and manufacture a multitude of electronic pressure sensors in multiple design and variants for example with different electrical outputs,pressure connections and packeges.
