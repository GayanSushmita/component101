# C0014-Water Level Sensor

## introduction to water level sensor,

A water level sensor is a device used to detect the level of water in a tank, reservoir, or any other water-containing vessel. It is commonly used in various industrial, commercial, and domestic applications where monitoring and controlling water levels are crucial. These sensors help prevent overflow or dry running, ensuring efficient use of water resources and preventing damage to equipment.

There are different types of water level sensors, including:

## Float Sensors:
These sensors use a buoyant float that rises and falls with the water level. As the float moves, it activates a switch, indicating the water level.

## Capacitive Sensors:
These sensors work by measuring changes in capacitance, which vary with the water level. They are non-contact sensors and are often used in applications where the sensor cannot come into contact with the water.

## Ultrasonic Sensors:
Ultrasonic water level sensors use sound waves to measure the distance between the sensor and the water surface. By calculating the time it takes for the sound waves to bounce back, the sensor can determine the water level.

## Pressure Sensors:
Pressure-based water level sensors measure the pressure exerted by the water at a specific depth. The pressure reading is then converted into a water level measurement.

## Conductive Sensors:
These sensors utilize the conductivity of water to determine its level. When the sensor's probes come into contact with the water, they complete a circuit, indicating the presence of water.

Water level sensors find applications in various fields, such as agriculture for irrigation systems, environmental monitoring, wastewater management, and industrial processes where precise control of water levels is essential

## How to connect to a circuit

The water level sensor has three pins: VCC, GND, and S (signal). To connect it to an Arduino circuit, you need to connect the VCC pin to the 3.3V or 5V pin on the Arduino, the GND pin to the GND pin on the Arduino, and the S pin to an analog input pin on the Arduino. Here's an example wiring diagram:

## The theory behind the components

The water level sensor works by using interlaced copper traces to form a variable resistor. The resistance varies based on how much the traces are exposed to water. The more water the sensor is immersed in, the better the conductivity and the lower the resistance. The less water the sensor is immersed in, the poorer the conductivity and the higher the resistance. The sensor generates an output voltage proportional to the resistance, which can be measured by an Arduino or other microcontroller to determine the water level.

## Features

- 10 exposed copper traces (5 power and 5 sense)
- Interlaced design with one sense trace between every two power traces
- Variable resistor design based on water immersion
- Analog output signal
- Can be powered from 3.3V to 5V

## Statistics

There are various types and models of water level sensors available on the market, with different features, specifications, and prices. Some common statistics that you may consider when choosing a water level sensor include:

- Input voltage range: 3.3V to 5V
- Output voltage range: 0V to VCC
- Sensitivity: typically around 20-200 mV per inch of water level change
- Accuracy: depends on the model and calibration, but usually within a few percent
- Response time: varies depending on the immersion depth and the design of the sensor, but usually within a few seconds to a few minutes
- Operating temperature range: depends on the model and the environment, but usually between -10°C to 85°C
