# C0004-Magnetic fields sensor

## Introduction

- Magnetic field sensors are electronic devices that detect and measure magnetic fields around permanent magnets, current conductors, and electrical devices. As the world becomes increasingly electrified, there is a growing demand for improved positional and current sensing.

## How to Connect to a Circuit

- To operate a sink sensor like the Honeywell 2SS52M, an external power supply should be connected to the sink through a resistor. When no magnetic field is detected, the sink works as an open switch and no current flows from the power supply to the device.  
- When a magnetic field is detected, the sink acts as a closed switch and some current flows from the external power supply to the device. To determine if the device is sensing a magnetic field, measure the voltage across the resistor. If it is zero, there is no external magnetic field present (apart from the Earth's magnetic field). If a strong enough magnetic field is placed close to the sensor, a voltage should be measurable.

## The Theory Behind the Components

- The Honeywell 2SS52M is a digital magnetoresistive sensor that detects magnetic fields oriented parallel to the longest side of its package (indicated by the white arrow on the device).
- The sensor is omnipolar, meaning that the orientation of the magnetic field doesn't matter – either a south-north or north-south alignment triggers the device. When the external magnetic field in a given direction is strong enough, the device works as a sink for current. Sink sensors have an output mode that is different from source sensors.
- To operate a sink sensor, an external power supply must be connected to the sink through a resistor.

## Features

- The Honeywell 2SS52M is a compact device with three pins – GND, VCC, and an output pin. It is highly sensitive to magnetic fields and can detect them even when they are weak. The sensor is compatible with a variety of electronic devices and can be used in many different applications, such as position sensing, current sensing, and rotational sensing.

## Statistics

- Unfortunately, as a language model, I do not have access to real-time statistics on the Honeywell 2SS52M or other magnetic field sensors. However, I can tell you that there are many different types of magnetic field sensors available on the market, each with their own unique features and specifications. When choosing a sensor, it is important to consider factors such as sensitivity, accuracy, and response time to ensure that it is well-suited for your specific application.
