## How to connect to a circuit

The rain board module is connected to the control board module, which is then connected to the Arduino board. The VCC and ground pins of the control board are connected to the 5V and ground pins of the Arduino, respectively. The D0 and A0 pins of the control board are connected to any digital and analog pins of the Arduino, respectively. The buzzer can be connected to any digital pin of the Arduino.

## Theory behind the components

The rain board module consists of two copper tracks that offer high resistance to the supply voltage under dry conditions. As the wetness on the board increases, the resistance gradually decreases, resulting in a decrease in the output voltage of the module. The control board module controls the sensitivity and converts the analog output to digital output. If the analog value is below the threshold value of the control board, the output is digital high.

## Features
